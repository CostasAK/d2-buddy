Reset Timers, Schedules, Activity Info and other helpers for Destiny 2.

## What it does

### [Timers](https://destiny2.kokke.eu/Timers)

- Shows upcoming events, and recurring events such as resets.
- Shows countdowns and times adjusted to your local timezone.
- Events are sorted by end or start time, depending on whether they are currently ongoing or not, respectively.
- Recurring events are sorted in order of occurence from now.
- Timers that cycle, like legend/master lost sectors, show the entire schedule when clicked.
- Activities can be clicked for full breakdowns of modifiers, shields and champions.

### [Links](https://destiny2.kokke.eu/Links)

Some links to my favorite D2 resources and tools. I have no affiliation with the sites listed. I just think they're great.
