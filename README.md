Reset Timers and other Countdowns for Destiny 2, in your local time with countdowns.

## What it does

- Shows upcoming events, followed by recurring events such as resets.
- Events are sorted by end or start time, depending on whether they are currently ongoing or not, respectively.
- Events disappear from the list once they are finished.
- Events without an end time, such as patches, remain in the list for 24 hours after their start time.
- Recurring events are sorted in order of occurence from now.
- Recurring events are reset and re-ordered on each occurence.
