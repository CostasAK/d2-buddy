Reset Timers and other Countdowns for Destiny 2, in your local time with countdowns.

## What it does

### [Timers](https://destiny2.kokke.eu/#/Timers)

- Shows upcoming events, followed by recurring events such as resets.
- Events are sorted by end or start time, depending on whether they are currently ongoing or not, respectively.
- Events disappear from the list once they are finished.
- Events without an end time, such as patches, remain in the list for 24 hours after their start time.
- Recurring events are sorted in order of occurence from now.
- Recurring events are reset and re-ordered on each occurence.
- Timers that cycle, like legend/master lost sectors, show the entire schedule when clicked.
- Activities can be clicked for full breakdowns of modifiers, shields and champions.

### [DIM Search Builder](https://destiny2.kokke.eu/#/DimSearchBuilder)

Customize what you want to label as trash and what you want to keep using this tools. It will produce various search strings that you can put into [Destiny Item Manager](http://destinyitemmanager.com/) to find trash, highlight interesting vendor items, etc, based on your preferences. Heavily inspired by and utilizing parts of [TMMania's Vault Analyzer](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fzn1iLI91aJOe3Wj9Vp7x41qIujjW1tRtoTLB6V_X7E/edit?usp=sharing).
